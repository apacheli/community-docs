# Introduction

Welcome to the _unofficial_ Discord API documentation. The aim of this project
is to explain the concepts of the Discord API in more detail. If you are still
confused about a concept that we have explained here, please don't hesitate to
join the [Discord API server](https://discord.gg/discord-api) to ask for help.
We want to make the documentation as clear and as concise as possible.
