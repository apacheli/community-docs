## Overview

Application commands are one the many ways that you can interact with your
application. There are currently three types of application commands that can
expect to see.

**Slash commands** can be invoked by typing `/` into the chat field. A menu will
pop up containing a list of available application commands for each individual
application.

**Message commands** can be invoked by right-clicking on a message and
navigating to the `Apps` option.

**User commands** can be invoked by right-clicking on a user and navigating to
the `Apps` option.
