## Table Definitions

Most structures will be represented by a table. There are two types of tables
that you can expect to find within the documentation:

- **Interfaces** will be represented using three headers: _Name_, _Type_, and
  _Description_.
- **Constants** will be represented using three headers: _Name_, _Value_ and
  _Description_.

In an interface, fields listed under _Name_ will be wrapped in `code`. A field
that is "optional" or "partial" will be denoted with _?_ after the code syntax.

In a constant, fields listed under _Name_ will always be written in uppercase
letters.
